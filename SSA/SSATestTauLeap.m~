% Programmed by: Ella Thomson
% Tracks the changes in amounts of three chemical reactants involved in
% three chemical reactions. The reactions occur at randomly distributed
% times. The program plots the quantities of all three substances vs time.
% It produces two plots; one figure with each substance on its own plot,
% and one figure with all three substances on the same plot.

% simulations up to 0.05 seconds each
